Init display,

Make webservice call,
	From response, parse out what nav links exist
	Populate breadcrumb list with current display as a parent and the nav links as children. Each item should contain information about
	NewTab, UseAsset, UseTimeRange
	Add current display link w/ parameters to array keeping track of links

When an arrow is clicked, make a new webservice call. Right before any new folder data is loaded, take the item from the current
item, add it to the link array.

Single clicking on a link should bring you to that link in the breadcrumb list.

When loading a new display, check that the link array is filled and populate in the parents.

Clicking a parent should make a new webservice call, every time the item is attempted to add to the link array,
it should be checked if it already exists, if it does, everything after is deleted. Single clicking should bring you to that display.
	This should handle upon loading as well
