Our prototype has the following known limitations:

1. Display name uses the name configured in the navigation link URL. This may be inconsistent with the display's actual name if it has been renamed or if it contains URL encoded/escaped characters.

2. The tool does not automatically update when navigation links are added/removed/updated on the display.
